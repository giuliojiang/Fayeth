\section{Introduction}

Fayeth is a fuzzer targeted to boolean satisfiability solvers. It can generate and mutate 
random inputs and attempt to trigger bugs in the System Under Test (SUT), or create CNF files 
that maximize the total code coverage of the software.

\section{Overview}

Fayeth is implemented in Java, and it can be executed in two different modes: 
Undefined Behaviour Mode and Functional Error Mode. The model of operation is simple: 
once started, Fayeth will automatically generate test cases and evaluate their 
effectiveness on the target SAT solver. The fuzzer can be stopped at any time, 
and the output directories will contain the generated inputs that Fayeth considers 
the most interesting.

\section{Undefined Behaviour Mode}

The Undefined Behaviour Mode is aimed at finding undefined behaviour bugs, crashes and timeouts in the
SAT Solver being targeted. It generates automatically random inputs of different kinds,
and observes the behaviour of the SUT to try to detect whether some bug has manifested itself.
The Undefined Behaviour Mode's detection power is amplified by the use of the Address
Sanitizer to compile the SAT Solver, giving Fayeth the ability to detect a wider range of
potentially silent bugs.\\

Fayeth can generate a range of inputs, which we can categorize as follows:

\begin{itemize}

		\item \verb|Random string| - A completely random sequence of characters, with an extremely low probability of representing a valid \texttt{DIMACS} file. This strategy helps to catch undefined behaviour happening during parsing.
		The length of the random string is not fixed and the strings generated contain any of the characters encoded in the first 8 bits of \texttt{UTF-8}, from \texttt{0} to \texttt{U+007F}. \\
		This is a good example of dumb fuzzing.
		See figure \ref{fig:random-string} for reference.
		
		\item \verb|Random DIMACS-like string| - A partially random string, resembling the structure of \texttt{DIMACS}. all of the 
		files generated start with \texttt{p cnf number1 number2}, where \texttt{number1} and \texttt{number2} are two random numbers
		and the rest of the file is composed of random integers (separated by space like \texttt{DIMACS}) and each line ends with a \texttt{0}, again like \texttt{DIMACS}. \\
		This strategy has the potential of causing overflows, as the \texttt{SUT} may allocate enough space for the data structure according to the \texttt{DIMACS} header, but the clauses and variables effectively created do not match the numbers specified in the header.\\
		This is an example of smart fuzzing.
		See figure \ref{fig:random-dimacs-like} for reference.
		
		\item \verb|Random Valid DIMACS| - A randomly generated \texttt{DIMACS} file, with reasonably large formulae, this strategy generates files that are perfectly valid \texttt{DIMACS}, but being relatively large aim at catching infinite loops or stack overflows. \\
		This is an example of smart fuzzing.
		See figure \ref{fig:random-dimacs} for reference.
		
		\item \verb|Random Broken DIMACS| - A mix of the \emph{Random strings} and the \emph{Random DIMACS-like string} strategies.
		This strategy generates a file that contains a valid \texttt{DIMACS} header like \texttt{p cnf number1 number2}, where \texttt{number1} and \texttt{number2} are two random numbers, followed by random \texttt{UTF-8} characters.
		This strategy aims to find bugs related to overflow and bad input sanitization.  \\
		This is technically smart fuzzing, but is closer to a dumb one in practice.
		See figure \ref{fig:random-broken-dimacs} for reference.
